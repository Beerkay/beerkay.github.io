### Personal 

Sailing is my passion, whether it's racing or cruising. I hold professinal sailing licence in my country (equivalent to [ASA 106](https://asa.com/certifications/), Advanced Coastal Cruising). I recently had a chance to sail on Charles River, Raritan Bay, and being at [Sail Boston'17](https://www.sailboston.com/).

I follow college sports closely. I am a huge fan of [Nittany Lions](http://www.gopsusports.com/), particularly when it comes to football and basketball.
