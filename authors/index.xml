      <description>I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University, co-director of the PurSec Lab and member of CERIAS. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Penn State University, where I was advised by Professor Patrick McDaniel and lead graduate student of the Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security Labratory (SIIS).
My research investigates the design and evaluation of security for software and systems, specifically on emerging computing platforms and the complex environments in which they operate.</description>
