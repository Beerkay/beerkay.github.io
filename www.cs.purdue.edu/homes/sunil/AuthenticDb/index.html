<h3>
<b><u>Project Summary</u></b></h3>

Due to the complexity and cost associated with managing data, many organizations are looking towards outsourcing
their data management services. In recent years especially, Cloud Computing has gained significant interest.
Although data outsourcing holds great promise, it raises a number of security and privacy concerns.
In particular, since the clients have little or no direct control over the software and hardware that is 
running at the servers, there is a reluctance to blindly trust the server. A server may sacrifice the quality 
of service for a client either intentionally or inadvertently.  In addition, there is a concern about the 
fidelity of the service.  Databases have precise semantics of operation which must be preserved by the 
outsourced database. There is a critical need to develop authentication mechanisms that allow a database
to be operated (for querying and updates) at an outsourcing site while providing guarantees to 
the data owner regarding transactional consistency of the database.

This project aims to make significant advances in the authentication of dynamic outsourced
databases.  The project will develop solutions that enable a data owner and authorized clients
to ensure that the outsourced database represents exactly the state that corresponds to valid transactions
that have been executed by the owner or clients. Comprehensive and efficient solutions that minimize the 
burden on the data owner, and the overhead on the outsourcing site for proving correct execution will be developed.
