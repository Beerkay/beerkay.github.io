                <p>
                  My research lies at the intersection of
                  networked systems and security, with a particular interest
                  in verification and testing of implementations of distributed
                  systems and network protocols. The overarching goal is to
                  design and develop automated techniques to ensure
                  secure and reliable operations of networked systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research have resulted in several publications in top peer-reviewed
                    conferences and journals, and have been integrated in curriculum twice
                    at Purdue University to teach students secure distributed systems programming.
                </p>
                <!--<p>
                    Apart from that, my interests also include reliability and security
                    aspects of software-defined networking, and application of various program
                    analysis techniques to network security problems.
