### About Me
I am a research assistant in Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Pennsylvania State University working with [Prof. Patrick McDaniel](http://www.patrickmcdaniel.org/) and lead graduate student of the [Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security Laboratory (SIIS)](http://siis.cse.psu.edu/). During my Msc. studies, I worked with [Prof. George Kesidis](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/) and [Prof. David J. Miller](http://www.ee.psu.edu/directory/FacultyInfo/Miller/MillerProfilePage.aspx). My research was on machine learning systems and network security. Previously I have worked at [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) evaluating the security of VMware source code, [Vencore Labs](https://www.perspectalabs.com/) building machine learning systems under privileged information, and [Istanbul Technical University](http://www.itu.edu.tr/en/) doing research on feature engineering for malware detection.
 
Generally, I am interested in developing secure systems through program analysis and machine learning. My recent work seeks to improve security, safety and privacy guarantees in commodity IoT.

#### Policy-based Secure Data Exchange 
<img align="left" src="{{ site.base }}/img/curie/curie.png" style="border-radius: 15px" hspace="15"> Data sharing among partners---users, organizations, companies---is crucial for the advancement of data analytics in many domains. Sharing through secure computation and differential privacy allows these partners to perform private computations on their sensitive data in controlled ways. However, in reality, there exist complex relationships among members. Politics, regulations, interest, trust, data demands and needs are one of the many reasons. Thus, there is a need for a mechanism to meet these conflicting relationships on data sharing. This paper presents Curie, an approach to exchange data among members whose membership has complex relationships. The CPL policy language that allows members to define the specifications of data exchange requirements is introduced. Members (partners) assert who and what to exchange through their local policies and negotiate a global sharing agreement. The agreement is implemented in a multi-party computation that guarantees sharing among members will comply with the policy as negotiated. The use of Curie is validated through an example of a health care application built on recently introduced secure multi-party computation and differential privacy frameworks, and policy and performance trade-offs are explored.

This paper is under peer-review: [Curie: Policy-based Secure Data Exchange](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08342.pdf), Z. Berkay Celik, Hidayet Aksu, Abbas Acar,Ryan Sheatsley, A. Selcuk Uluagac and Patrick McDaniel, 2017. We extend the algorithms used in Curie paper and construct algorithms for [Achieving Secure and Differentially Private Computations in Multiparty Settings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08342.pdf). This paper is accepted to IEEE Privacy-aware computing (PAC) conference.

We also studied the detection of Fast-Flux Service Networks (FFSNs) using DNS (Domain Name System)
response packets. We have observed that current approaches do not employ a large combination of DNS features to feed into the proposed detection systems. The lack of features leads to high false positive or false negative rates triggered by benign activities including Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). Read more about the study [here](https://beerkay.github.io/papers/Celik13_ISCC.pdf).


During my Msc. studies, I worked with [Prof. George Kesidis](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/) and [Prof. David J. Miller](http://www.ee.psu.edu/directory/FacultyInfo/Miller/MillerProfilePage.aspx) on NSF NeTSE Unsupervised Flow-Based Clustering project (also supported by Cisco Systems URP gift and DHS/NSF EMIST/DETER project). My research there focused on network security and machine learning. 


I also worked under the direction of [Prof. Sema Oktug](http://web.itu.edu.tr/~oktug/) at [Istanbul Technical University](http://www.itu.edu.tr/en/) focusing on practical network security problems (e.g., fast-flux networks).
