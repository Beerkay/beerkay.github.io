### About Me

I am a research assistant in Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Pennsylvania State University working with [Prof. Patrick McDaniel](http://www.patrickmcdaniel.org/) and a member of the Systems and 
Internet Infrastructure Security Laboratory (SIIS). 

Previously, I worked with [Prof. George Kesidis](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/) and [Prof. David J. Miller](http://www.ee.psu.edu/directory/FacultyInfo/Miller/MillerProfilePage.aspx) on NSF NeTSE Unsupervised Flow-Based 
Clustering project (also supported by Cisco Systems URP gift and DHS/NSF EMIST/DETER project) during my Msc.studies. My research there focused on network security and learning algorithms. 

I also worked under the direction of [Prof. Sema Oktug](http://web.itu.edu.tr/~oktug/) at [Istanbul Technical University](http://www.itu.edu.tr/en/) focusing on practical network security problems (e.g., fast-flux networks).


### Projects

I've had the opportunity to work on a number of interesting research projects during my Msc. and PhD. studies. Here is a summary of some of my efforts. 


#### Detection with Privileged Information

box-shadow: 5px 8px 10px #e0e0e0" hspace="15"> Modern detection systems use sensor outputs available in the deployment environment to probabilistically identify attacks. These systems are trained on past or synthetic feature vectors to create a model of anomalous or normal behavior. Thereafter, run-time collected sensor outputs are compared to the model to identify attacks (or the lack of attack). While this approach to detection has been proven to be effective in many environments, it is limited to training on only features that can be reliably collected at test-time. Hence, they fail to leverage the often vast amount of ancillary information available from past forensic analysis and post-mortem data. In short, detection systems do not train (and thus do not learn from) features that are unavailable or too costly to collect at run-time. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in machine learning to integrate privileged information---features reliably available at training time, but not at run-time---into detection algorithms. We apply three different approaches to model training with privileged information: knowledge transfer, model influence, and distillation.

This paper is under peer-review: [Building Better Detection with Privileged Information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09638v1.pdf), Z Berkay Celik, Patrick McDaniel, Rauf Izmailov, Nicolas Papernot and Ananthram Swami, arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.09638, 2016.

#### Malware Traffic Detection and Experimentation Artifacts
<img align="left" src="{{ site.base }}/img/malware/malware.png" style="border-radius: 15px;
box-shadow: 5px 8px 10px #e0e0e0" hspace="15"> We present a framework for evaluating the transport layer feature space of malware heartbeat traffic.
We utilize these features in a prototype detection system to distinguish malware traffic from traffic generated by legitimate
applications. In contrast to previous work, we eliminate features at risk of producing overly optimistic detection results, detect previously
unobserved anomalous behavior, and rely only on tamperresistant features making it difficult for sophisticated malware
to avoid detection. Further, we characterize the evolution of malware evasion techniques over time by examining the behavior of 16 malware families. In particular, we highlight the difficulty of detecting malware that use traffic-shaping techniques to mimic legitimate traffic. Read more about the study [here] (https://beerkay.github.io/papers/celik15_Milcom).

In our [CSET 2011](https://beerkay.github.io/papers/celik11_CSET) work my co-authors and I also take a closer look at the experimentation artifacts of malware detection. We find that current approaches do not consider timing-based calibration of the C&C traffic traces prior to using this traffic to salt a background traffic trace. Thus, timing-based features of the C&C traffic may be artificially distinctive, potentially leading to (unrealistically) optimistic flow classification results.

We also studied the detection of Fast-Flux Service Networks (FFSNs) using DNS (Domain Name System)
response packets. We have observed that current approaches do not employ a large combination of DNS features to feed into
the proposed detection systems. The lack of features leads to high false positive or false negative rates triggered by benign
activities including Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). Read more about the study [here](https://beerkay.github.io/papers/Celik13_ISCC).


#### Science of Security

Perhaps the most ambitious projects I am involved in is the 10-year Cyber-Security Collaborative Research Alliance ([CSec CRA](http://cra.psu.edu/) with the Army Research Laboratory, Penn State, Carnegie Mellon, UC Riverside, UC Davis, and Indiana University. Our mandate is to develop a new science of security. As part of this effort, I've worked on the foundation for representing of operational and environmental knowledge. (See my work on operational models [here](ontology1). Our goal to reason about both current and future states to make optimal security decisions.
