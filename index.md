### About Me
I am a research assistant in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Pennsylvania State University working with [Prof. Patrick McDaniel](http://www.patrickmcdaniel.org/) and lead graduate student of the [Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security Lab (SIIS)](http://siis.cse.psu.edu/people.html). During my Msc. studies, I worked with [Prof. George Kesidis](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/) and [Prof. David J. Miller](http://www.ee.psu.edu/directory/FacultyInfo/Miller/MillerProfilePage.aspx). My research was on machine learning (ML) systems and network security. Previously I worked at [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) evaluating the security of VMware software source code, [Vencore Labs](https://www.perspectalabs.com/) building ML systems under privileged information, and [Istanbul Technical University](http://www.itu.edu.tr/en/) doing research on feature engineering for malware detection.


Generally, I am interested in developing secure systems through program analysis and machine learning. My recent work seeks to improve  safety, security, and privacy guarantees in commodity IoT.
