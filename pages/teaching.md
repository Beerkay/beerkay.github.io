### Teaching

##### CS 529: Security Analytics (Graduate), Fall 2019 [[Syllabus]](http://beerkay.github.io/courses/cs529/content/syllabus/CS529.pdf)

This graduate-level course will provide students with materials to discuss the intersection of two ubiquitous concepts: Security and Machine Learning. The course is structured in two parts: (1) Machine Learning for Security and (2) Security of Machine Learning Systems. The focus of the first part will be on building a principled understanding of key learning algorithms and techniques, and their applications within the security domain, as well as general questions related to analyzing and handling datasets. The first part will provide students with the necessary background to understand the second half of the course. The second part covers recently discovered security implications of deploying machine learning algorithms in the physical realm. Students will learn about attacks against computer systems leveraging machine learning algorithms, as well as defense techniques to mitigate such attacks during learning and inference. The course aims to motivate the exploration of new problems that advance the state-of-the-art; thus, the course will include reviewing recent papers from top-tier conferences. Students successfully completing this class will be able to evaluate machine learning systems in academic and commercial security, and will have rudimentary skills in security and machine learning research.
